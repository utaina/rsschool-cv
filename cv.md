Despite never taking an English certification exam, I’ve had plenty of practice. Communication in English was essential in my previous position as a visa officer. Part of my courses at the university was in English. Apart from that, I’ve had plenty of opportunities to participate in educational and exchange programs in English, among them:

* Study visit to the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) (Strasbourg, March 2018);
* Council of Europe Winter School on European Human Rights Standards (Belarus, January- February 2018);
* Course on ECHR and ECtHR within the European Program for Human Rights Education for Legal Professionals (HELP) (Belarus, December 2017)
